Pascal-Like-Simple-Language-Compiler-Project

Language: C++

The compiler was three-part project consisting of a lexical analyzer, parser, and interpreter with grammar

It is designed such that it compiles the given code and throws back any error- syntax, compiler, logical, etc.
like a functioning compiler.
